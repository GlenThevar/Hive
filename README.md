# 🐝 Hive - A Decentralized Social Content Platform

**Hive** is a blockchain-based social application that empowers users to share content, connect through conversations, build personal profiles, donate to creators, and interact with posts through likes, comments, and saves — all on a decentralized network.

Built using **Thirdweb** and **IPFS via Pinata**, Hive ensures your content is secure, censorship-resistant, and user-owned. Currently running on the **Sepolia testnet**, Hive is under active development.
