## Introduction

Hive is a blockchain based social media, it is a project that I decided to work upon in order to get a better understanding of how blockchain works. This project is a still a work in progress and I keep on itterating on it whenever I get the time to. I used thirdweb which allows users to build Dapps by abstracting most of the complexity. I used react and tailwind in order to build the frontend of the application along with daisy UI for the components. Additionally I have used pinata in order to store the images on the IPFS network. As of now, Hive is operating on the sepolia test nestnet.

##  Features

- Create posts and store them on the IPFS network
- Comment on posts, like posts and comments
- Support users by donating directly to them
- Set up personal profiles
- Save posts you enjoy
- Chat with other users


## Tech Stack Used

- **Frontend:** React & Tailwind
- **Backend:** Solidity, Pinata and Thirdweb
